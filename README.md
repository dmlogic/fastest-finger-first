# Fastest Finger First

This project allows some [cheap buzzers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DG5W91QW) to be adapted to run via a PI which will listen for the clicks and only allow the "fastest finger" to light up and sound the buzzer.

The PI also acts as a display for the successful player name and a means to reset ready for the next question.

Because spending several weekends doing this is clearly easier than watching out for who pressed the buzzer first.

This is not show-off code. This is a vibe-coded mush so the family can play quizzes at Christmas.
